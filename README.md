# basketball-mapping
What if we looked at access to basketball hoops as an indicator for wellness and quality of life? Currently, there is no dataset that helps us understand the distribution of public basketball hoops across the City of Houston.

# research
- Look at possibility of detecting hoops via satellite imagery
- Find vacant lot dataset

# data to assemble
- YMCA locations: https://www.ymcahouston.org/locations/
- Churches in Houston: http://www.churches-in.com/texas/houston/
- Neighborhood Centers: http://www.neighborhood-centers.org/locations
- Additional one-off gems from: http://basketball.isport.com/basketball-courts/?&l=77004&k=&ct=US
- HCAD for vacant land (requires MS Access): http://pdata.hcad.org/download/
- Public right of way, easements, abandoned streets, etc. (TXDOT, Harris County)
- Blighted, abandoned, or unoccupied properties

# technical
- concatenate and categorize different datasets
- plot existing data on a map
- create tool to suggest hoop locations (OpenPlans?)
