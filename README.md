# basketball-mapping
What if we looked at access to basketball hoops as an indicator for wellness and quality of life? Currently, there is no dataset that helps us understand the distribution of public basketball hoops across the City of Houston.

# research
- Assemble parks data from open data portal
- Look at data from churches, schools, rec centers, etc.
- Look at possibility of detecting hoops via satellite imagery

# technical
- concatenate and categorize different datasets
- plot existing data on a map
- create tool to suggest hoop locations (OpenPlans?)
