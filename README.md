# basketball-mapping
What if we looked at access to basketball hoops as an indicator for wellness and quality of life? Currently, there is no dataset that helps us understand the distribution of public basketball hoops across the City of Houston.

# research

- YMCA locations: https://www.ymcahouston.org/locations/
- Churches in Houston: http://www.churches-in.com/texas/houston/
- Neighborhood Centers: http://www.neighborhood-centers.org/locations

# technical
- concatenate and categorize different datasets
- plot existing data on a map
